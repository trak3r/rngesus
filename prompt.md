- is it more proper and standard to say "your likes" or "my likes" or somethingn else altogether?
- defaulting to "newest" doesn't show our best face; i think "most liked" should be the default

# Test Guidelines
- write test coverage for any logic changes
- write test coverage for any functionality changes
- never create/build/update in a test unless those functions are explicitly being tested; use fixtures instead
- name fixtures descriptive of their test purpose, for example: "user_with_vulgar_nickname"
- make sure all tests pass before telling me you are finished
