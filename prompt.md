- we need to genericize the tag names
- delete all the current tags - they are name brands
- replace with these new tags:
    - Forest
    - Town
    - Dungeon
    - Treasure
    - Magic
    - Encounter

# Test Guidelines
- write test coverage for any logic changes
- write test coverage for any functionality changes
- never create/build/update in a test unless those functions are explicitly being tested; use fixtures instead
- name fixtures descriptive of their test purpose, for example: "user_with_vulgar_nickname"
- make sure all tests pass before telling me you are finished
