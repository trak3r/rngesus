OK let's add some tagging to randomizers.
Randomizers can be tagged with one or more tags.
But for now users can only select one tag.
Seed the site with these initial tags to choose from:
- Shadowdark
- Dolmenwood
- JAGS
- Dungeons & Dragons
- System Agnostic
Show the tag on the randomizer index cards and the randomizer show page.
Clicking on the tag should filter the index to only show randomizers with that tag.
Even though we're only allowing and displaying one tag for now, we will support multiple tags in the future, so don't pigeon hole the design.

the tag pills are causing some wrapping issues on the randomizer index cards. could you put the tag at the top center overlapping the border of the card; like it were a push pin or piece of tape holding the card to a cork board?
