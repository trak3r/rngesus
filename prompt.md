let's play with the visual theme of the site.
we want to inspire nostalgia of:
- old school dungeons and dragons
- black and white pen ink art
- the 1980s
- high school
- pencil notes
- trapper keepers
- spiral bound notebooks
- notebook paper with 3 hold punch
- index cards
- saturday morning cartoons
- summer break
keep everything standard with tailwindcss and daisyui.
use best practices for accessibility and consistency.
if it's within your power, generate and add imagery to the site.
