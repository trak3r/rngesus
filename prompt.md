OK i loved the black and white notebook style design but it started to wear on me. it's a little too much. Too cliche. Too much black ink; lacking contrast and color. 
Let's take another bold big swing approach and try to clean things up.
First of all, for inspiration let's think of the old D&D books from the 80s, specifically their font and layout and black ink imagery.
Think of their clean table design for all the dice rolls and results.
Also consider use of whitespace to avoid busy cluttered screens and make things easy for the user to read and scan.
Use color sparingly and only for important elements to draw the user's eye to the most important parts of the page.

looking good so far.
not a fan of the font; maybe a sans-serif font would be better.
don't need so much padding in the randomizer cards; maybe half as much.
go ahead and contine to the depper pages and make sure to clean up the design.

something broke big here. looks like you're showing the results value rather than the text. there was a lot of desired functionality here so you might want to roll back to the previous version and try again.

i'm not seeing any new design elements applied to the list of results on the rolls show page.

you broke lots of hover functionality on the results cards. they used to be able to be clicked to reroll, and now they can't. also they used to show the raw name and now they don't.

the results in the list are still showing the old design of purple gradient wells and colored icons.
