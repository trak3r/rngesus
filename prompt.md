- the "No randomizers found" message should be in the same style as the card layout, perhaps to the right of the "new randomizer" card. impress me.

# Test Guidelines
- write test coverage for any logic changes
- write test coverage for any functionality changes
- never create/build/update in a test unless those functions are explicitly being tested; use fixtures instead
- name fixtures descriptive of their test purpose, for example: "user_with_vulgar_nickname"
- make sure all tests pass before telling me you are finished
