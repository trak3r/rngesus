OK let's add some tagging to randomizers.
Randomizers can be tagged with one or more tags.
But for now users can only select one tag.
Seed the site with these initial tags to choose from:
- Shadowdark
- Dolmenwood
- JAGS
- Dungeons & Dragons
- System Agnostic
Show the tag on the randomizer index cards and the randomizer show page.
Clicking on the tag should filter the index to only show randomizers with that tag.
