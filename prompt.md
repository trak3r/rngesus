everywhere a create or update occurs in a test, replace with a fixture unless the actual update or create is being tested

(include wiht all prompts:)
- write test coverage for any logic changes
- write test coverage for any functionality changes
- never create/build/update in a test unless they are being tested; use fixtures instead
- make sure all tests pass before telling me you are finished
