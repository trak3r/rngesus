OK i loved the black and white notebook style design but it started to wear on me. it's a little too much.
Let's take another approach and try to clean things up.
First of all, for inspiration let's think of the old D&D books from the 80s, specifically their font and layout and black ink imagery.
Think of their clean table design for all the dice rolls and results.
Also consider use of whitespace to avoid busy cluttered screens and make things easy for the user to read and scan.
Use color sparingly and only for important elements to draw the user's eye to the most important parts of the page.
