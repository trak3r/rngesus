- if you can generate artwork, make some old school D&D-style black and white ink art of monsters, dungeons, mages and warriors, etc. the same dimensions as the cards and randomly pepper one in the list of randomizers each page reload
- the artwork is always showing as the first card. it should randomly appear as first to fifth
- the artwork is too tall. make it the same height as the cards
- you're cropping the artwork to the shape of the card but it's not looking good because the images are tall. please generate images that are the same dimensions as the cards (wide and short)
- the dungeon image is perfect. make the others like it

# Test Guidelines
- write test coverage for any logic changes
- write test coverage for any functionality changes
- never create/build/update in a test unless those functions are explicitly being tested; use fixtures instead
- name fixtures descriptive of their test purpose, for example: "user_with_vulgar_nickname"
- make sure all tests pass before telling me you are finished
