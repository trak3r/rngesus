OK let's revisit the animated dice - a really cool feature that only works half the time.
problems to address:
- the animated dice roll should happen when the outcome page is first loaded
- some of the "predefined" dice (see the model) are not animating
- the dice don't roll to the same result as returned from the server
- if possible without too much PITA it would be nice to see random colors and textures for the dice on each roll

- on an outcome page with multiple rolls, the dice appear and disappear as each consecutive roll triggers. could we leave all the dice on the screen?
