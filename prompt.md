# Style Guidelines
- always consider dark mode and light mode
- always consider mobile and desktop

# Internationalization & Localization Guidelines
- any verbiage presented to a user should come from the en.yml file

# Test Guidelines
- write test coverage for any logic changes
- write test coverage for any functionality changes
- never create/build/update in a test unless those functions are explicitly being tested; use fixtures instead
- name fixtures descriptive of their test purpose, for example: "user_with_vulgar_nickname"
- make sure all tests pass before telling me you are finished
