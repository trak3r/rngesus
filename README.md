# Done
- rails new
- randomizers
- rolls
- favicon dice icon
    - https://fontawesome.com/icons/dice?f=duotone&s=solid
    - https://game-icons.net/1x1/delapouite/dice-twenty-faces-twenty.html#download
    - https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/
- results
- dice types
- is this the proper way to do edit-in-place?
    - https://nts.strzibny.name/single-attribute-in-place-editing-turbo/
- audit for vestigal scaffold files (and controller actions)
- too many rubocop rules disabled; not cleaning up code
- https://tabler.io/icons
- special dice types (2d6, with-advantage, etc.)
- `erb-format app/views/**/*.html.erb --write`
- support d100 logic (digit position not sum)
- upload screenshot of printed table automatically built (ocr)
    - add "import results" button to Roll show
    - prompts for drag or upload file (image or csv)
    - submit uploads the file, converts it to result objects, back to Roll show
- better styling with daisyui https://daisyui.com/components/list/
- tests (once there's complicated enough logic to warrant)
- discovered by accident that (a) tailwind supports OS dark mode toggle and (b) it's broken as fugg on my pages
- add helper tips on screnshot upload for cropping and layout with example image
- user registration
    - prefer to use third-party exclusively - no password management internally

        - https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/wiki/List-of-Strategies
- support for rolls within results like "1d4 treants"
    - recognize patterns like "XdY" and link them to impromptu roller
    - a pop-up modal or just a hover tooltip might be slick (client-side JS)
- test with a dolmenwood table since it has different font and colors than shadowdark
- find and disable the rubocop that effs up block comments
- add alt names for rolls (e.g. "Coin Flip" for d2)
- add JAGS roll 4d6-4
- try larger zoomed test image, and if it helps add to upload tips
- `erb_lint -a app/views`
- (x) see if we can fix the OCR smushing the first letter of sentence with second word, like "A cat" always comes through as "Acat"
- ownership of randomizers
- likes / favorites
    - https://github.com/ryanto/acts_as_votable
- search, type-ahead quick find
- on the outcomes page of a multi-roll randomizer, allow clicking on any single roll to re-roll just that result
- animate spin results like a slot machine
- promotion lists: newest, most liked, my favorites, my randomizers
