# TODO
- upload screenshot of printed table automatically built (ocr)
    - add "import results" button to Roll show
    - prompts for drag or upload file (image or csv)
    - submit uploads the file, converts it to result objects, back to Roll show
- easy way to combine randomizer and roll together (e.g. forest encounter monster and reaction tables)
- support for rolls within results like "1d4 treants"
    - recognize patterns like "XdY" and link them to impromptu roller
    - a pop-up modal or just a hover tooltip might be slick (client-side JS)
- would we need to support "advantage" rolls?
- better styling with daisyui https://daisyui.com/components/list/
    - are we actually using anything from daisy?
- registration
- ownership of randomizers
- share via links with guid not raw id
- tagging / categories
- search, type-ahead quick find
- cool 3d dice roll on screen
- spin results like a slot machine
- responsive/mobile screens
- hotwire native
- hardening
- accessibility
- tests (once there's complicated enough logic to warrant)
- re-enable github ci workflow
- donations / patreon
- affiliate links to buy real dice
- sponsors
