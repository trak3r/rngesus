# TODO
- support for rolls within results like "24-25: 1d4 treants"
- would we need to support "advantage" rolls?
- easy way to combine randomizer and roll together (e.g. forest encounter monster and reaction tables)
- better styling with daisyui https://daisyui.com/components/list/
    - are we actually using anything from daisy?
- registration
- ownership of randomizers
- share via links with guid not raw id
- tagging / categories
- search, type-ahead quick find
- cool 3d dice roll on screen
- spin results like a slot machine
- responsive/mobile screens
- hotwire native
- hardening
- accessibility
- tests (once there's complicated enough logic to warrant)
- re-enable github ci workflow
- donations / patreon
- affiliate links to buy real dice
- sponsors
- upload screenshot of printed table automatically built (ocr)
