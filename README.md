# What is it?
- A tool for creating tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) random dice roll tables and rolling on them to get results
- With some added cool features like uploading a photo or screenshot from a book and automatically building everything 
- When a result contains an embedded roll, like "2d6 goblins", it will roll that and insert the result into the text

# Why am I building it?
- Free-time project to play with some technologies I don't get to use at my day job
- SQLite (I've been using PostgreSQL for over a decade, MS-SQL before that)
- Hotwire: Turbo / Stimulus (I use React and React Native now, Backbone.js before that)
- Tailwind CSS & DaisyUI (I use Bootstrap at work)
- Avo for admin (I have experience with Rails Admin)
- Omniauth without Devise and exclusively third-party authentication
