# TODO
- delete confirmation broken and AI just running in circles so we'll come back to that later
- animate cool 3d dice roll on screen
    - only showing on the reroll, not the initial roll (not working consistently)
    - often have to hard-reload a page to see the dice; seems navigating around causes them to stop working
    - 3d dice don't roll to same result as returned from server
    - what are our options for dice colors and textures?
- tagging / categories, searchable and browsable
- private flag for randomizers, or published_at timestamp
- pagination of randomizers
- toggle to disable animations on settings page
- combine randomizers (e.g. forest encounters + reaction rolls)
    - copy rather than link?
- would we need to support "with advantage" rolls?
    - is there a standard syntax for it? 2d20kh1
- distribution graphs for multi-dice rolls
- responsive/mobile screens
- hotwire native
- hardening (scan tools?)
- accessibility (scan tools?)
- re-enable github ci workflow
- hide / report offensive items
- set up email exceptions so i'm notified of bugs i don't see myself
- free hosting?
    - database backups
- google analytics
- SEO
- donations / patreon
    - https://buymeacoffee.com/signup
- affiliate links to buy real dice
- sponsors

# Done

- rolls
- favicon dice icon

    - https://game-icons.net/1x1/delapouite/dice-twenty-faces-twenty.html#download
    - https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/
- results
- dice types
- is this the proper way to do edit-in-place?
    - https://nts.strzibny.name/single-attribute-in-place-editing-turbo/
- audit for vestigal scaffold files (and controller actions)
- too many rubocop rules disabled; not cleaning up code
- https://tabler.io/icons
- special dice types (2d6, with-advantage, etc.)
- `erb-format app/views/**/*.html.erb --write`
- support d100 logic (digit position not sum)
- upload screenshot of printed table automatically built (ocr)
    - add "import results" button to Roll show
    - prompts for drag or upload file (image or csv)
    - submit uploads the file, converts it to result objects, back to Roll show
- better styling with daisyui https://daisyui.com/components/list/
- tests (once there's complicated enough logic to warrant)
- discovered by accident that (a) tailwind supports OS dark mode toggle and (b) it's broken as fugg on my pages
- add helper tips on screnshot upload for cropping and layout with example image
- user registration
    - prefer to use third-party exclusively - no password management internally
    - (x) https://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#authentication
    - (x) https://github.com/heartcombo/devise
    - https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth
        - https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth/wiki/List-of-Strategies
- support for rolls within results like "1d4 treants"
    - recognize patterns like "XdY" and link them to impromptu roller
    - a pop-up modal or just a hover tooltip might be slick (client-side JS)
- test with a dolmenwood table since it has different font and colors than shadowdark
- find and disable the rubocop that effs up block comments
- add alt names for rolls (e.g. "Coin Flip" for d2)
- add JAGS roll 4d6-4
- try larger zoomed test image, and if it helps add to upload tips
- `erb_lint -a app/views`
- (x) see if we can fix the OCR smushing the first letter of sentence with second word, like "A cat" always comes through as "Acat"
- ownership of randomizers
- likes / favorites
    - https://github.com/ryanto/acts_as_votable
- search, type-ahead quick find
- on the outcomes page of a multi-roll randomizer, allow clicking on any single roll to re-roll just that result
- animate spin results like a slot machine
- promotion lists: newest, most liked, my favorites, my randomizers
- share rollable randomizers via links with guid not raw id
- share buttons, link, social media
- weird roll type: d4 + d10 as digit positions
- d40 NPCs in the City of Masks
    - does not OCR and parse
- avatar; is gravatar still a thing?
- settings page (nickname, avatar)
- profanity / vulgarity detector
- upload multiple screenshots at once; the carousing benefits is 4 pages
