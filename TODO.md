# TODO

## Must Have / Bugs
- (UI) move tabs into header?
- (UI) the roll form page is left justified while all other pages are centered
- (UI) roll results page: remove the "Manage Results" it's redundant of the edit icon
- (UI) roll results page: move the tags to the top center of the card like they are for rolls
- (UI) roll results page: make the roll result value number larger
- (UI) roll results page: deemphasize the roll name, center it
- (UX) add email address verification
    - when a user changes their email, consider it pending until they confirm...
    - via receipt of an email with a link
    - devise probably has this functionality (or there's a plug-in)
    - this is likely going to require setting up a GMail app key for outgoing mail through msmtp
- (UI) make it more clear visually that resuls cover the range (gap) between values on the roll results edit form
- (UX) private, published, public flag or timestamp for randomizers
- (UX) latest version of roll edit form doesn't allow (re)upload img/csv
    - what is expected behavior when re-uploading into an existing roll?
    - replace matching values? dupe everything?
- add a second (exotic) language just to demonstrate i18n support
- re-enable github ci workflow (as long as there's no costs involved)

## Nice to Have
- export to CSV?
- (UI) on forms, instead of showing error at top of page, show it inline with the offending field
- (tech debt) the non-CRUD controller-actions leave a bad taste in my mouth; let's audit them and considering refactoring
- (UX) let users specify *any* dice type with a parse-able shorthand (e.g. 3d12-5)
- (UX) let users link accounts, e.g. log in with twitter then link discord so both work
- (UX) user option to hide / report offensive items
- (UI) 3D dice don't roll to same result as returned from server
- (UX) toggle to disable animations on settings page
- (UX) let user copy somebody else's randomizer as their own
    - be careful not to deep clone likes, guid/slug; just the basics
- (UI) stamps on cards, like top ten, rising star, missing stuff / needs attention, etc.
- (admin) does Avo support filter, search, sort?
- (UX) ability to drag and reorder results; automatically change values?
- consider dice-less rolls; just random result from list that could be any size
- golden tickets (inspired by Fizzy) for promoted cards
- integration as a discord bot?
- community can add notes or propose typo fixes to other user's data (like pull requests)
- combine randomizers (e.g. forest encounters + reaction rolls)
    - copy rather than symlink?
- do we need to support "with advantage" rolls?
    - is there a standard syntax for it? 2d20kh1
- distribution graphs for multi-dice rolls, informative eye candy

## User Requests
- (marco) U should be able to upload a picture to go along with the table
- (phil) Allow a copy paste of the table. Greatly improves time so a user doesnt have to screen shot, save an image then upload. They can just snip it and paste it.
- (phil) You find a "Roll on Metal Table" Sword. And that Roll on Metal table would be like, iron, steel, cold iron, silver etc.
    - basically referential tables linked from results
    - in his example he uses the Markdown syntax (ala Obsidian)
    - note this could also be extended to cover the "roll again and combine results" style of results
- (todd) recommend a < or something next to the roll name to save me 10ms mousing over to the site logo to get back to the front page

## Mobile
- responsive/mobile screens
- PWA
- hotwire native

## Hosting
- database backups (offsite)
- set up email notifications for exceptions so i'm notified of bugs i don't see myself (will require msmtp setup)
- SEO
- google analytics
- hardening (scan tools?)
- accessibility (scan tools?)

## Monetization
- just to cover hosting costs
- affiliate links to buy real dice
- sponsors

    - https://game-icons.net/1x1/delapouite/dice-twenty-faces-twenty.html#download
    - https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/

- dice types
- is this the proper way to do edit-in-place?
    - https://nts.strzibny.name/single-attribute-in-place-editing-turbo/
- audit for vestigal scaffold files (and controller actions)
- too many rubocop rules disabled; not cleaning up code

- special dice types (2d6, with-advantage, etc.)
- `erb-format app/views/**/*.html.erb --write`
- support d100 logic (digit position not sum)
- upload screenshot of printed table automatically built (ocr)
    - add "import results" button to Roll show
    - prompts for drag or upload file (image or csv)
    - submit uploads the file, converts it to result objects, back to Roll show
- better styling with daisyui https://daisyui.com/components/list/
- tests (once there's complicated enough logic to warrant)
- discovered by accident that (a) tailwind supports OS dark mode toggle and (b) it's broken as fugg on my pages
- add helper tips on screnshot upload for cropping and layout with example image
- user registration
    - prefer to use third-party exclusively - no password management internally

- support for rolls within results like "1d4 treants"
    - recognize patterns like "XdY" and link them to impromptu roller
    - a pop-up modal or just a hover tooltip might be slick (client-side JS)
- test with a dolmenwood table since it has different font and colors than shadowdark
- find and disable the rubocop that effs up block comments
- add alt names for rolls (e.g. "Coin Flip" for d2)
- add JAGS roll 4d6-4
- try larger zoomed test image, and if it helps add to upload tips
- `erb_lint -a app/views`
- (x) see if we can fix the OCR smushing the first letter of sentence with second word, like "A cat" always comes through as "Acat"
- ownership of randomizers
- likes / favorites
    - https://github.com/ryanto/acts_as_votable
- search, type-ahead quick find
- on the outcomes page of a multi-roll randomizer, allow clicking on any single roll to re-roll just that result
- animate spin results like a slot machine
- promotion lists: newest, most liked, my favorites, my randomizers
- share rollable randomizers via links with guid not raw id
- share buttons, link, social media
- weird roll type: d4 + d10 as digit positions
- d40 NPCs in the City of Masks
    - does not OCR and parse
- avatar; is gravatar still a thing?
- settings page (nickname, avatar)
- profanity / vulgarity detector
- upload multiple screenshots at once; the carousing benefits is 4 pages
- tagging / categories, searchable and browsable
- delete confirmation broken and AI just running in circles so we'll come back to that later (somehow magically working now)
- pivot tagging from brands to generic; don't want to deal with potential headache of takedowns and C&D
- kamal deploy
    - remember to put data on external volume so ya don't lose it
        - rails already did that by default (yay)
    - test on sandbox virtual machine
        - http://localhost:4080/
- terms of service, privacy policy, etc.
- admin tools
- soft delete
- imagery; would be cool if pages looked like old D&D manuals with black & white ink art filling dead space on the page
- free hosting?
    - https://render.com/docs/deploy-rails-8
        - *after* you get your site set up, they tell you they are going to delete your database in 30 days if you don't upgrade to a paid plan (dirty)
        - and the database never did connect despite configuring the DATABASE_URL environment variable as per their instructions
    - https://fly.io/docs/rails/getting-started/ (cheap but not free)
- get SSL working (enforced) with free cert generation
- we can't collect emails from twitter SSO until we have a public site with privacy policy URL
    - i enabled it but don't seem them coming over - oh well
- does Discord have SSO? yup, done
- disable facebook; it's not working and who uses it?
- create/update result should go back to roll show page, not result show page
    - kill the result#show action, view, route
- creating and editing randomizers could use some more handholding
    - consider a wizard-style flow
- now that real people are using it, i over-engineered it to support crazy cool functionality that most users will not need and made the learning curve too steep. smush it all down into single roll tables.
- when we switched to wizard flow we lost CSV upload option
- if user logged in, default landing page / logo link to "your rolls", else "most liked"
- attention-needed icon on rolls missing results or results outside of dice range, etc.
- don't show incomplete, test, draft, randomizers (except to owner)
- (eric) I should be able to cutty pasty from the roll!
    - only the corner "reroll" ribbon is a click target now
- (marco) Needs a Misc category.
    - a catch-all tag doesn't add any value to tagging, but i have added more variety
- the roll card design needs a revisit after randomizers were deprecated
    - the index-cards style is out of place now that the notebook paper background has been abandoned
- sometimes reloading the page on production results in 404 or "missing content" errors
- gravatars don't work without emails and some of the integrations aren't providing emails
- the outcomes page could have a link to a read-only view of a roll
    - the current roll#show is the outcome so that needs to be rethought
- the slot spinning effect make the card shake when some results have more lines than others
- move slugging into a concern
- the 3D dice aren't appearing on the hosted site (only on workstation)
- pagination of randomizers
- some new dark-mode issues have crept back in
    - how does this keep happening? theory: vanilla tailwind vs. daisyui
    - can we automate and audit for these?
- there's sometimes some lag before the slot machine animation starts (haven't seen recently perhaps something else addressed it)
- https://buymeacoffee.com/teflonted
- (tech debt) need to audit the en.yml file for:
    - keys that aren't referenced anywhere
    - keys that are blank empty string can be removed *with* their referencing code
